# Get People Budget Exercise

In this exercise you have to write code in the file `getBudget.js` for calculating the budget of a list of people.

Each person will be represented by the object: 

```javascript
{ 
  name: "John",
  age: 21,
  budget: 23000 
},
```

and the `people` variable will hold a list of different multiple persons.

You should write the code inside the curly braces, where it says `Your amazing code here`.

## Examples

```javascript
getBudgets([
  { name: "John", age: 21, budget: 23000 },
  { name: "Steve",  age: 32, budget: 40000 },
  { name: "Martin",  age: 16, budget: 2700 }
]) âžž 65700

getBudgets([
  { name: "John",  age: 21, budget: 29000 },
  { name: "Steve",  age: 32, budget: 32000 },
  { name: "Martin",  age: 16, budget: 1600 }
]) âžž 62600
```

## Local Test

For testing your code you must run: 

```sh
npm install

npm run test

```

## Notes:

- You can read the test files, so you can have an idea of what is the expected result, but **do not edit them** please.

- The result must be a *Number*.

- **Extra points** if you don't use `for` in your solution.
